    "# Cross-Feeding Simulation\n",
    "Here we will simulate cross-feeding between two species of bacteria, inspired by previous work by [Dukovski et al., 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-021-00593-3). For this purpose we will simulate two strains of *E. coli*: one which cannot uptake lactose and one which cannot metabolize galactose - with lactose being the only environmental carbon source being lactose set to a chemostat."
